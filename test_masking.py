# Quick test to confirm that caching is working as intended. The two first passes together should produce roughly the
# same logits between them as the third pass, unless causal masking is incorrectly applied for the cached tokens,
# which it seems to be when using the built-in causal modes of SDP and xformers attention. Explicitly supplying a
# correct mask at least works for SDP, although it probably leaves some performance on the table.
# TODO: Make it not be the way that it is but so that it works instead.
